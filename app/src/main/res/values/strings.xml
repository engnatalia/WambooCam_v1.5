    <string name="open_wamboo">Oops! Something went wrong. However, your video was recorded and you can compress it using Wamboo.</string>
    <string name="body3">What does this mean? Well, with smaller files, you\'ll be taking a valuable step towards reducing your carbon footprint. And that\'s not all! Wamboo Cam is so efficient that it minimizes your phone\'s battery consumption while compressing your photos and videos. What does that mean? Less pollution associated with battery usage. Isn\'t that marvelous? On the other hand, traditional compression apps tend to be wasteful, draining your battery and generating unnecessary pollution. Imagine having to charge your phone more frequently and spend more electricity! With Wamboo Cam, you won\'t have to worry about that.</string>
    <string name="body4">"But that's not all. Did you know that traditional cameras don't compress files? That means they take up too much space on your device. But with Wamboo Cam, all of that changes. Not only will you save money on storage (goodbye to expensive hard drives or cloud storage services), but you'll also save on electricity! Yes, you heard it right. You'll be able to enjoy your videos and photos without worrying about unnecessary expenses! So, dear friends, we fervently encourage all of you, including you and all the multimedia enthusiasts out there, to take a step forward and join the exciting world of Wamboo Cam. Especially if you believe your videos could go viral or be shared time and time again. Just imagine how many tons of CO2 emissions we could avoid each year! And if you already have a mountain of videos waiting to be compressed, fear not, because Harmony Valley has a sister application designed specifically for that: Wamboo, the eco video compressor!

    <string name="external_directory">Failed to get external storage directory</string>
    <string name="rotation_issue">Oops! If you took a horizontal photo, try again, and before pressing \"Accept,\" put your phone back in a vertical position.</string>
    <string name="size_issue">Couldn\'t be calculated, but check the pic metadata in your phone\'s gallery! We promise the compressed pic will be very small!</string>
    <string name="instructions">To capture a video or take a picture in horizontal orientation, click one of the top buttons, hold your camera horizontally, and before confirming the capture, rotate it back to the vertical position to avoid layout resetting (although it may not always occur). Enjoy capturing your moments! </string>
    <string name="instructions2">Anyway, if that happens, your file is probably saved and you can compress your videos using the amazing Wamboo Eco Compressor! Donwload it completely free here.</string>
